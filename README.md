# SQL Challenge - Module 9 Project Challenge

# Files
1. `Schemata.sql` - This file contains the Data Engineering work for the project.
2. `DataAnalysis.sql` - This file contains the queries used for data analysis.

## Project Overview
In this project, I accomplished the following tasks:
1. I carefully examined the data files and designed an appropriate schema to structure the database effectively.
2. I translated the designed schema into a functioning database structure using PGADMIN, setting up the required tables and relationships.
3. I ensured the correct association of primary and foreign keys throughout the database, maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between tables.
4. I loaded the provided CSV files into the database. To maintain the integrity of the data, I followed a specific order: 
   1. Load `titles.csv`
   2. Load `employees.csv`
   3. Load `departments.csv`
   4. Load `dept_manager.csv`
   5. Load `dept_emp.csv`
   6. Load `salaries.csv`
5. **I developed query files (`DataAnalysis.sql`) to perform meaningful data analysis, extracting insights from the structured data.

Acknowledgments
I want to acknowledge that I completed this project independently, utilizing a combination of classroom resources and online references to create the code. The project exemplifies my understanding of SQL concepts and practices learned throughout the course.
